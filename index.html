            <h2>Big Dream </h2>
            <h3>Become A successful Web Developer</h3>
            <p>For those interested in a career in development, there are many aspects to consider. Firstly, you need a passion for writing code. The web moves fast, and it will be a big part of your job to move with it. Youâ€™ll have to learn new languages and get your hands on new tools as time goes by.</p>
            <p>To succeed in computer science, problem-solving skills are a must, as well as logical, rational thinking. Patience and ability to keep your head cold are also two things that will help you a lot in your future job.</p>

            <p>I am fullstack developer, who know React, Javascript, Nodejs, Express, SQL Databases and Mongodb. I have 1 year of experience. I mostly work on Restful API's and develop small frontend with React.</p>

            <h2>Beginner Level Web Developer</h2>
            <h3 class="sky-highlight">2020-2021 | Self Learner</h3>
            <p>I recommend doing Steps 1, 2, and 3 in order. Then, depending on whether you want to focus on more front-end or back-end, you can do steps 4a or 4b in any order. <br>
               I personally think itâ€™s good idea for front-end web developers to know at least a bit of back-end, and vice versa. At the very least, learning the basics of both will help you figure out if you like front-end or back-end web development better ðŸ™‚</p>
